Define a model of an XML document, Create a Shema and Transform XML data to JSON data and vice versa
Modeling of an XML database to store the data of a language holiday agency. 

You should distinguish among different kinds of holidays proposed : for adults or families or children/teen agers, summer camps, school groups, family immersions, etc, You should model the various aspects of a language holiday agency: not only data describing language holiday offers (languages, destinations, language classes, language tests, sport or cultural activities), but also clients, teachers, proposed dates, etc.

Describe your modeling choices in natural language. Think about the advantages and disadvantages of your choices and discuss them.
Write an XML Schema that represents your modeling
Write a valid XML database against this model, containing a representative extract of the database of some library.
Imagine 5 different scenarios requiring the visualization of part of this data and write 5 XSL stylesheets to answer them.
Imagine a 6th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in another XML format and write a stylesheet for this.
Imagine a 7th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in JSON format and write a stylesheet for this.
You will be evaluated according to the quality and richness of your modeling (modular schema, fine grained type definitions), the scenarios imagined and the quality of your stylesheets (prefer a recursive XSL programming style that extensively uses XPath).

Upload a zip file containing:

A report of max 5 pages in pdf format presenting:
your modeling choices behind your XML schema, and the advantages and disadvantages of your choices for the processing of the data
your XSLT transformations and the use cases they answer
Also precisely indicate in your report
your working environment, and the tools or online services you used.
your source XML file
your XML Schema file
your XSLT files containing in comments their description in natural language
the output of your XSLT transformations
the JSON Schema of the 5th output
